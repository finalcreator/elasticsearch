#Elasticsearch aggregations enable you to get meta-information about your search results and 
#answer questions like, "How many account holders are in Texas?" or "Whatâ€™s the average balance of 
#accounts in Tennessee?" You can search documents, filter hits, and use aggregations to analyze 
#the results all in one request.
